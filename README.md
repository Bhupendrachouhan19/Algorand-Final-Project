## 📃 Project Description

TOLMA is an innovative cross-chain aggregator designed to streamline and enhance decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Algorand blockchain. By facilitating seamless interactions across multiple blockchains, TOLMA simplifies complex cross-chain financial operations, making DeFi more accessible and efficient. Our platform offers a user-friendly interface, robust data-driven dashboards, and advanced analytics, empowering users to manage their assets effortlessly across different chains. With TOLMA, we aim to revolutionize the DeFi landscape by providing a comprehensive solution for cross-chain finance.

## 🚀 Our Vision

Our vision for TOLMA is to democratize decentralized finance (DeFi) by creating an intuitive, secure, and unified platform that bridges the gap between multiple blockchains. We aim to simplify the complexities of DeFi, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical expertise. By addressing key challenges such as liquidity fragmentation, user experience complexity, and inefficiency, we strive to empower users globally with seamless cross-chain financial operations.

We envision a future where financial inclusion is a reality for all, enabling economic empowerment and fostering innovation across diverse communities. TOLMA will be the guiding force in the DeFi landscape, akin to a GPS for financial journeys, providing users with the best routes to grow and manage their assets. Our commitment is to continuous improvement and innovation, ensuring TOLMA remains at the forefront of DeFi, delivering unparalleled value, security, and opportunities for wealth creation to our users worldwide.

## </> Dev Stuff

### Problems faced while building this project:
- #### Account creation issue
    - Creating New account was no longer supported 
    - Importing new account from Pera Mobile account was also not supported
    - Import account using recovery passphrase was also not supported.

    Due to above mentioned issues we were not able to create or import a new account using Pera wallet in algorand testnet. 
    We tried other Algorand wallets as well but they also didn't working, some wallets were only allowing us to conect with the mainnet but not with testnet.  

- #### Tech stack issue
    - Since the the Algorand project template was only available in TypeScript and our dev-mates were only familiar with ReactJS and NextJS based projects, so a lot of our time was spent to learn TypeScript, other technologies. Since our project has many different types of complex data-driven dashboards with lots of graphs and data-visuals, because of this huge learning curve and the time constraint, we were not able to reach our final product. But we have a plan to take our ideas to next level by build this project and taking it out to real-world.

### Current Progress:
- UI designs of essentails components are completed.
- A figma prototype of this project is also available.

### Future Work:
- Coding/Development
